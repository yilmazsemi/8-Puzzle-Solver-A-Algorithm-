# 8-Puzzle-Solver-A-Algorithm-
As the space moves, the 8-square puzzle is automatically solved.
The initial state is given automatically. Then it is checked whether the puzzle can be solved or not. The puzzle is solved until it reaches the end state. A* algorithm is integrated. You can change the end state, so you can solve the puzzle for different end states.
